# K-Means Clustering and Image Color Compression

## Overview
This project implements the K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch using Python and applies it to perform color compression on images. K-Means clustering is a popular unsupervised learning algorithm used for partitioning data into K clusters based on similarity.

## Features
- **K-Means Algorithm**: Implemented from scratch to cluster data points into K clusters.
- **Color Compression**: Applied K-Means to compress images by reducing the number of colors while maintaining visual quality.

## Results
- **Cluster Visualization**: Shows the clustering results with visualizations using matplotlib.
- **Image Compression**: Compares the original image with the compressed image after applying K-Means clustering.
  
## Acknowledgments
- Inspired by the need to understand and implement K-Means clustering from scratch.
- Built as a learning exercise for data clustering and image processing.
